# Text-Generation-Model
A generative AI project that produces coherent text based on user prompts using transformer-based language models.

🧠 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

This project implements a Text Generation Model that produces meaningful and coherent text based on a user-provided prompt. The application uses a pre-trained generative language model to predict and generate sequences of words.
Text generation models are widely used in chatbots, content creation tools, automated documentation systems, and conversational AI applications. The implementation allows easy modification of input prompts within Google Colab.
