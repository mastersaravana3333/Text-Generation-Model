🧠 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

This project implements a Text Generation Model that produces meaningful and coherent text based on a user-provided prompt. The application uses a pre-trained generative language model to predict and generate sequences of words.
Text generation models are widely used in chatbots, content creation tools, automated documentation systems, and conversational AI applications. The implementation allows easy modification of input prompts within Google Colab.

⚙️ 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀

The model takes an input prompt and generates a sequence of words by predicting the most probable next tokens. The generation parameters can be adjusted to control creativity and length.
The implementation is simple, modular, and easy to experiment with in Google Colab.
